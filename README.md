Set of tools to analyze the performance of single cards and draw statistics for your Mtg Cube.

## TODO
* [ ] Add a meta-language to add cards, decks, games
* [ ] Add relative parsers (scripts should consume the commands)
* [ ] Add way to visualize the data simply
* [ ] Add data-processing functions (ELO per type, per mv etc.)
